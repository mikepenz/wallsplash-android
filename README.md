#wall:splash for Android
**wall:splash** is the cutting edge wallpaper app for your device!

**wall:splash** uses **Unsplash** as image source, which already features over **2000 images**.

The current version includes following features:
* over 2000 images
* browse the images
* material design
* clean and minimalistic
* many animations
* set the wallpaper with a single click
* set and crop the wallpaper with a long click

This application was designed with the new Material Design principles in mind. It gives you a perfectly fluid user flow with simple and fresh animations. It also unleashes the full power of Android Lollipop by providing bright colors fetched out of each single wallpaper.
